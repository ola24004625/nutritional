                <h3>What are the effects of better sleeping habits</h3>
                <p>Reduced Stress and Anxiety: Adequate sleep helps regulate the body's stress hormones. With better sleep habits, you're likely to experience less anxiety, feel more emotionally stable, and handle stress more effectively. Chronic sleep deprivation is linked to an increased risk of depression. By improving sleep habits, you support your mental health and reduce the likelihood of experiencing depressive symptoms. </p>
                <p> Good sleep is essential for a well-functioning immune system. Regularly getting adequate rest helps the body defend itself against infections and illnesses. Sleep helps regulate hormones related to hunger (like ghrelin and leptin), helping to control appetite and potentially reduce the risk of overeating or weight gain.</p>
                <p>With better sleep habits, youâ€™ll wake up feeling more energized, which means you're likely to be more productive and efficient throughout the day. Athletes and physically active individuals benefit from better sleep in terms of strength, endurance, and recovery.</p>
